I am now a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Xiamen University, advised by Prof. [Bin Ren](https://bren.xmu.edu.cn). 
I received my M.S. degree in Physical Chemistry from Xiamen University in 2023. 
My research interests include computational spectroscopy and machine learning. 
I am also interested in the application of machine learning assisted spectroscopy in the field of biology and environment.
