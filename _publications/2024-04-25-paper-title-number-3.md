## Abstract
Spectrum–structure correlation is playing an increasingly crucial role in spectral analysis and has undergone significant development in recent decades. With the advancement of spectrometers, the high-throughput detection triggers the explosive growth of spectral data, and the research extension from small molecules to biomolecules accompanies massive chemical space. Facing the evolving landscape of spectrum–structure correlation, conventional chemometrics becomes ill-equipped, and deep learning assisted chemometrics rapidly emerges as a flourishing approach with superior ability of extracting latent features and making precise predictions. In this review, the molecular and spectral representations and fundamental knowledge of deep learning are first introduced. We then summarize the development of how deep learning assist to establish the correlation between spectrum and molecular structure in the recent 5 years, by empowering spectral prediction (i.e., forward structure–spectrum correlation) and further enabling library matching and de novo molecular generation (i.e., inverse spectrum–structure correlation). Finally, we highlight the most important open issues persisted with corresponding potential solutions. With the fast development of deep learning, it is expected to see ultimate solution of establishing spectrum–structure correlation soon, which would trigger substantial development of various disciplines.
